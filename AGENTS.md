# AGENTS.md

## Mission
Build a production-grade seller-audit tool through small, reviewable changes.

## Required playbook
For development work, use https://github.com/Bambale0/skills as the primary engineering playbook.
Prefer engineering/productivity skills, use in-progress only when appropriate, and do not use deprecated skills.

## Product rules
- MPStats/browser data is reconstruction evidence, not the final accounting source.
- Official WB/Ozon/FNS documents remain the source of truth for final tax conclusions.
- Tax calculations must be deterministic code, never delegated to an LLM.
- LLMs may classify products or explain uncertain mappings, but must return structured data with confidence.
- Never fabricate primary documents, expenses, contracts, invoices, or retroactive records.
- Keep capture logic minimally invasive: reuse the user's authenticated browser session, never store credentials.
- Do not hardcode one seller. Seller 739228 is the initial test case only.
- Every legal/tax rule must be configurable and documented with an effective date before being treated as production logic.

## Shared Engineering Baseline — Start + AuRoom

This shared baseline supplements repository-specific rules; it never replaces stricter local architecture, release, security, channel, or product constraints.

### Engineering playbook and task flow
- Treat `Bambale0/skills` as the primary engineering playbook. Also inspect relevant safe guidance from `Bambale0/claw` and `anthropics/skills`.
- Do not use deprecated skills. Use in-progress skills only when they fit and account for their experimental status.
- Large ambiguous work: use a wayfinder-style flow.
- Feature development where applicable: `grill-with-docs → to-spec → to-tickets → implement → tdd → code-review`.
- Debugging: diagnose from evidence first (logs, telemetry, DB/runtime state, reproducible behavior), then patch.
- Never claim tests, CI, deploy, or production state that was not actually verified.

### Mandatory feature preflight and CONTEXT ledger
Before implementing any material feature or cross-cutting refactor, perform a fresh audit of the current repository state. Inspect relevant docs/specs/ADRs, code, schemas/migrations, auth, admin/config surfaces, tests, CI, integrations, and runtime telemetry when available.

Use the repository-designated execution ledger for active work. If `CONTEXT.md` is explicitly documented as that ledger, maintain it. If `CONTEXT.md` already serves another purpose, do not repurpose it; use an existing repository-local ledger path or create `docs/agents/EXECUTION.md`. Record baseline commit/SHA, current state, what exists/partial/missing/reusable, risks/dependencies, migrations/integrations/permissions/rollout impact, intended user outcome and acceptance criteria, no-hardcode/configuration decisions, observability plan, test seams, numbered steps with progress evidence, final verification, and follow-ups. Do not reconstruct it only at the end.

### No hardcode and control plane
Mutable business/runtime behavior must not require source edits, manual SQL, or redeploys. Prices, tariffs, categories, statuses, SLA, prompts, provider/model selection, routing, thresholds, schedules, feature availability, notification templates, retry/fallback policy, permissions, and integration mappings should normally be typed, validated, database-backed, scoped, auditable, and manageable through the appropriate authenticated admin/control plane.

Secrets are not business configuration. Never expose plaintext secrets in frontend bundles, logs, API responses, Git, or ordinary database settings.

### Architecture and integrations
- Prefer a modular monolith with explicit module interfaces and seams unless scaling, security, reliability, or ownership evidence justifies extraction.
- Important cross-module state changes should use explicit, typed, versionable, traceable, retry-safe/idempotent events where eventing is appropriate.
- Keep provider-specific HTTP payload handling behind typed integration adapters/ports.
- External integrations must define auth, finite timeouts, bounded retries/backoff, rate-limit behavior, idempotency, webhook verification where supported, reconciliation, data ownership/sync direction, observability, and failure semantics.
- Avoid parallel sources of truth.

### Security and AI authority
Authorization is enforced server-side. UI hiding is never sufficient. Preserve ownership/tenant boundaries where applicable and treat data leakage as a release blocker.

AI may classify, summarize, extract, recommend, and execute only explicitly permitted workflows. It must not bypass authorization, approvals, deterministic validation, financial controls, legal signing, or tenant/data isolation. Low-confidence or high-impact actions should fail closed or escalate.

### Observability first
Logging and telemetry are part of the implementation. Critical paths should expose what happened, when, for which actor/entity/scope, through which provider, duration, retries, failure reason, and user-visible effect. Propagate useful request/trace/correlation IDs. Never log secrets or unnecessary personal data.

### Test-first vertical slices and completion gate
Prefer `failing behavior test → minimal implementation → focused checks → next slice`.

For every material feature, explicitly cover where applicable: unit/domain behavior, DB/repository integration and migrations, authorization/ownership/tenant isolation, provider contracts, workflow/idempotency/retry, API integration, browser/bot E2E, smoke/deployability, observability/audit, and admin configurability/no-hardcode.

Regression fixes should get regression tests when feasible. Do not mark work complete until applicable acceptance criteria and checks pass; when repository CI exists and is accessible, it is green for the exact commit; review against repository standards and the originating spec is complete; and no unresolved high-severity finding remains. If CI is unavailable or the repository has no CI, record that explicitly and run the closest available local checks instead.

### Delivery
Final engineering reports should state what changed; important files/components; skills/flows used; exact tests/checks and results; migrations/config/admin changes; risks/follow-ups; and PR/commit/deploy SHA when applicable.
